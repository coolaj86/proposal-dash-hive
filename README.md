# Dash Hive

This repository contains files related to Dash Hive proposals.

Dash Hive is a (proposed) Dash Treasury cooperative (co-op); It is an organization dedicated to serving the Dash community.  Members are (will be) admitted based primarily on residence, values, and stake.  Specifically, members will generally live in or around Utah (primarily the Wasatch Front, including Salt Lake City, Provo, and Ogden), they will agree, at least loosely, to the guiding principles of the organization (yet to be documented), and they will obtain/retain a minimum stake in Dash (yet to be defined).

The co-op will seek funding from the Dash Treasury on an ongoing basis through Dash Treasury proposals.  These proposals will be stored here in this repository.  Storing proposal material here on GitHub allows interested parties to view modifications over time for any and all documents.  It also enables collaboration and sharing between interested parties.

The first proposal will be in the form of a letter of intent (LOI).  That proposal will request *no funds*.  The purpose will be to propose the creation of a new Dash Treasury co-op (organization funded by the Treasury on an ongoing basis) called Dash Hive.  The LOI will explain to the Dash community what Dash Hive intends to do for Dash, and what we will expect in return - in other words, the reciprocal intentions between the Dash Treasury and Dash Hive.

Subsequent proposals will request funding for work *already accomplished*.  The will also propose future work that we will expect to be paid for when it is accomplished.  These proposals will include detailed scopes of work, schedules, and budgets for tracking the performance and status of projects and programs conducted and administered by Dash Hive.
