# Paper Wallet Tool

### Overview

I will fill this out shortly.  

Basically, this project would continue to build out [this tool](https://github.com/riongull/paper_wallet_tools).  
The tool helps track the status of paper wallet giveaways.  The improvements would including the following:

* Add ability to automate the process of pulling back funds from unclaimed, distributed paper wallets
* Create a user interface for the tool (right now it's just a node.js script you'd run from a command line)
