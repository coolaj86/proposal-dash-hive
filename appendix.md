### Q & A

##### Why is it called Dash Hive

Dash Hive's members would mostly live in [Utah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah).  Utah's nickname is "The Beehive State".  The accompanying motto is "Industry".  We feel that's a good characterization of what we would like to accomplish with Dash Hive, with the co-op focusing on being industrious producers of high quality products and services.

Some principles Dash Hive would uphold include: 
* The [cypherpunk manifesto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cypherpunk#Main_principles): 
> "cypherpunks write code"
* Buckminster Fuller's sentiment:
> “You never change things by fighting the existing reality.
To change something, build a new model that makes the existing model obsolete.” 

The main idea is that Dash Hive will be industrious - writing, developing, building.

##### What is a cooperative (co-op), why are you using that term

A [co-op](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative) is an autonomous association of persons united voluntarily to meet their common economic, social, and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly-owned and democratically-controlled enterprise".

We feel it's an appropriate model to follow for this organization, as it follows many of the principles we want to implement.  Co-ops are flexible, but generally follow [these principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rochdale_Principles):

* Voluntary and open membership
* Democratic member control
* Member economic participation
* Autonomy and independence
* Education, training, and information
* Cooperation among cooperatives
* Concern for community

##### What is a letter of intent (LOI), why are you including one

A [letter of intent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_of_intent) is a document outlining one or more agreements between two or more parties before the agreements are finalized.  LOIs are useful for the following (among others):

* Allow parties to sketch out fundamental terms quickly before expending substantial resources on negotiating definitive agreements, finalizing due diligence, pursuing third-party approvals and other matters
* Declare officially that the parties are currently negotiating, as in a merger or joint venture proposal
* Serve to protect both parties to a transaction

Specifically for this project, it will be useful in recruiting membership for Dash Hive.  An agreed-to LOI will show recruits (who may be unfamiliar with the Dash Treasury process) that MNOs are agreeing in good faith to fund activities that people may spend significant time and money producing.

##### Why is content hosted on Github instead of Dash Central

* It's somewhat difficult to format on Dash Central
* This particular proposal has several components, which lends itself better to being hosted on Github
* Hosting on Github allows people to track proposal revisions
* Hosting on Github allows people to link to very specific parts of the proposal, or even suggest changes
