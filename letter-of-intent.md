# Letter of Intent

Dear masternode operators (MNOs) and community, 

This letter of intent (LOI) is meant to convey Dash Hive's desire to enter into a working relationship with the Dash Treasury, as described below and in the [accompanying proposal](https://github.com/dashcommunity/proposal-dash-hive/blob/master/proposal.md).  MNOs signify their reciprocal desire by voting yes on the proposal.

### Parties

* Service provider: Dash Hive
* Service recipient: The Dash community at large
* Funding party: Dash Treasury, governed by Dash MNOs

### Agreement

Dash Hive will secure and maintain ongoing, long-term availability to develop and support products and services for Dash.  In turn, Dash MNOs agree to financially support such efforts upon satisfactory completion of scopes of work. Funding level will vary over time, generally starting low and increasing with demand and satisfaction.

### Services

Products and services can either be proposed by Dash Hive or solicited in the form of requests for proposals (RFPs) by Dash MNOs and the community at large.  To better facilitate solicitations some improved tooling may be required.  In general, all products and services Dash Hive develops would be vetted openly prior to commencing work.  All required tooling to administer the co-op can be built along the way.

### Terms & Payment

This partnership is intended to be long-term.  The scope of work and budget will start small, but we intend to accommodate whatever level of scale the community can support.  All recruits will join with the understanding that their work will start small, and be compensated only after it is completed.  Skilled work is generally not accustomed to that level of risk, and it's not easy to attract talent without good potential for long-term sustainability and growth.  We expect this document to help reassure potential recruits that Dash can offer fairly-compensated work with good long-term prospects.

### Ownership

Work would be funded by the community (through MNO voting).  Therefore, work products should be owned by the community.  All treasury-funded work products (code, intellectual property, documentation, operations, tooling, etc) will be open sourced.  We believe this is not only financially fair, but it also stimulates innovation and good-will, both within our own community as well as towards other communities.

### Default & Enforcement

This is in no way a legally-binding document.  In Dash Hive's opinion, contracts are enforced most effectively through peaceful (non-state) means, including innovative technology-based workflows such as what we're proposing here.  Should either party default on (fail to uphold) the above agreement, this should simply be publicized in the community; social repercussions would then follow.
