# Request for Proposal Tool

### Overview

I will fill this out shortly.  

Basically, this project would be to develop a tool that can be used to accept and manage community solicitations.  
Community members could upload products they want built, services they want administered, etc and people could then vote on which ones are most popular.  When there's clear support for something Dash Hive (or any other group) could then create proposals based on the idea/requirements.  Some basic features would include the following:

* People can submit ideas of things they want (products or services)
* People can vote on submitted ideas
* Voting could potentially be a stake-based, where 1 Dash owned = 1 vote
