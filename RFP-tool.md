# Request for Proposal Tool

### Overview

This project is one piece of the overall [scope of work](https://github.com/dashcommunity/proposal-dash-hive/blob/master/proposal.md#scope) of the [Dash Hive proposal](https://www.dashcentral.org/p/dash-hive).

The main deliverable for this project would be a **user-friendly web site/application that accepts and manages requests for proposals**.  This tool would be used by masternode operators (MNOs) and the Dash community at large.  The preliminary estimate to build the minimum viable product (MVP) is **$5,000 (USD)**.  It can be delivered within **3 weeks** of commencement.

Further detail regarding the scope of work, schedule, and budget are provided in later sections.

##### Background & Motivation

Dash Hive aims to be an organization that serves the Dash community through custom-made products and services.  As such, it needs a way for the community (in particular MNOs) to express their interests in what projects to undertake.  That process can start with informal conversations and posts in places like the Dash forum, Reddit, Slack, Discord, etc, but at some point there needs to be a way to manage and prioritize all the various ideas that come up.  It makes sense to have a tool that specializes in this, even if used just interally by Dash Hive.

In addition to the need for such a tool internal to Dash Hive, the Dash community in general could potentially also benefit from having one.  Several conversations in the Dash community over the years have raised this issue.  People have expressed the need for community members and MNOs to have a targeted means of requesting work products and/or services from prospective contractor.  This is in contrast to the typical process of ideas originating from treasury contractors.  Such a process is not unique to Dash, it's standard practice in many industries, and is called a request for proposal, or RFP for short.

In general, a [request for proposal (RFP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Request_for_proposal) is a document that solicits a proposal, often made through a bidding process, by an agency or company interested in procurement of a commodity, service, or valuable asset, to potential suppliers to submit business proposals.  It is submitted early in the procurement cycle, either at the preliminary study, or procurement stage.  An RFP is used where the request requires technical expertise, specialized capability, or where the product or service being requested does not yet exist, and the proposal may require research and development to create whatever is being requested.

Specifically for Dash, that "agency or company" would be the Dash Treasury, governed by its MNOs.  Although MNOs would be the one's voting on treasury proposals emerging from this process, it may make sense to broaden RFP participation to others as well.

This aim of this project would be to create a tool that can be used both interally (by Dash Hive) and externally (by the Dash commmunity at large) to manage RFPs. 

The RFP tool would have the following benefits:

* MNOs could express their desires to current and future treasury contractors
* Conversely, contractors would have a better idea of what products and services they can propose to the Treasury
* Ideas for projects would be more discoverable than sifting through various forum discussions
* Because these ideas would be more discoverable:
  * the community would get the products/service more quickly
  * the products/services would be developed more affordably, due to (potentially) competing bidders

### Scope

The main deliverable for this project would be a user-friendly web site/application that accepts and manages RFPs.  It would be used by MNOs and the Dash community at large.  Dash Hive proposes to build the MVP and open source it on a platform where any and all developers can contribute to it.

People would have the ability to do the following:

* **view** existing RFPs, including those added by Dash Hive and general community members
* **register** for the site
  * either using traditional means
  * or potentially with a dash address
* **upload** ideas for products and/or services they want built/administered
* **vote** on which ones they like and dislike
  * Voting could potentially be a stake-based, where 1 Dash owned = 1 vote

When there's clear support for something, Dash Hive (or any other group) could then create proposals that satisfy the requirements (combining ideas or handling them separately, as seen fit).

### Schedule

This project can be completed within **3 weeks** of commencement.  More granular project milestones may be added later.

### Budget

The budget is based on time and materials estimates required to complete the scope of work.  Itemized cost estimates are shown below.

> Note: These costs are **rough estimates**, meant for budgetary purposes only.  Items may be added and/or edited up until completion:

* Project managment: **$1,000**
  * refine customer requirments
  * coordinate work assignments
  * community reporting, internal communications, documentation
* Web content development:  **$1,000**
  * past/future event research
  * best practices
* Web site/application development: **$3,000**
  * architecture
  * application development
  * testing, etc

Total cost is **$5,000**, requested in full upon completion.

### Closing

Thank you for your time and consideration.
